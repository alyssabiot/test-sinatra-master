Ruby on Rails Essay

We want to create an app which lets students take driving lessons with teachers, on specified meeting points.

1. The teachers can give lessons on one or more meeting points.
2. The teachers can create availabilities (Ex: April, 15th 2017, from 8am to 11am and from 3pm to 6pm).
3. Lessons last 1 or 2 hours.
4. The students can list teacher availabilities for a specific meeting point and lesson duration (1 or 2 hours).
5. The students can book a lesson with a teacher at specific meeting point and datetime, for a specific time.
6. The teachers can accept or decline lessons bookings.

Describe the data model youâ€™d use for this app. What are the key models? What are their attributes? How will your code use them?

>
The app will contain 5 models :
- Student
- Teacher
- MeetingPoint
- Availability
- Booking
See file "db_schema.png" for details of the database's structure

The key models are Booking, Availability and MeetingPoint because they connect the models Student and Teacher and are the core of the app.
Their attributes are :
- MeetingPoint :
    - location :string
    - teacher_id :references
- Availability :
    - date :date
    - starts_at :time
    - duration :integer
    - teacher_id :references
- Booking :
    - student_id :references
    - teacher_id :references
    - meeting_point_id :references
    - availability_id
    - date :date
    - starts_at :time
    - duration :integer
    - accepted :boolean, default :false

When a Student is looking for a lesson, it can select a date and time and location => this will show a list of available Teachers.
The Student can ask for a Booking with the choosen Teacher at wanted date, time and location for 1 or 2 hours.
If the Teacher validates the Booking, the "accepted" attributes becomes "true" and the corresponding Availability is either deleted or updated according to the duration of the lesson.
