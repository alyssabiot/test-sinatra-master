1. Give a regular expression that detects hexadecimal numbers in a text.
For example, ‘0x0f4’, ‘0acdadecf822eeff32aca5830e438cb54aa722e3’, ‘8BADF00D’ should be detected.

>
/\A(0[xX])?[0-9a-fA-F]+\z/

2.Here is the pseudo code of a function that is defined recursively:
-  f(0) = 1;
-  f(1) = 3;
-  f(n)= 3 * f(n-1) - f(n-2);
Provide an implementation for ‘f’. Bonus points for a non recursive implementation.

>
def f(n)
  if n == 0
    1
  elsif
    n == 1
    3
  else
    numbers = [1, 3]
    (2..n).each do |n|
      numbers << 3 * numbers[n - 1] - numbers [n - 2]
    end
    numbers [n]
  end
end

RoR

1. Write a CREATE TABLE query for a table storing information on users. It will store:
  - id,
  - firstname,
  - lastname,
  - gender,
  - email,
  - created_at

>
create_table :users do |t|
  t.string :firstname
  t.string :lastname
  t.string :gender
  t.string :email
  t.datetime :created_at
end

2. Write a query on the previous table that lists the 10 most recently added users.

> User.all.order(:created_at).limit(10)

3. How would you do to check if a user has signed up (with devise gem) in the last 24 hours and if so redirect this user to "google.fr", before every action of every controller?

>
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  if current_user.created_at > Time.now - 24.hours
    redirect_to "www.google.fr"
  end
end

4. In your app, you have a header in your layout.html.erb. You want for this header a white background on a specific action of a specific controller, and a black background in every other case. How would you do?

>
Add a "if statement" in the layout before defining 2 headers : one black and one white depending on the controller
